Contributors
============

Initially developed by [Christian Schiffler](https://www.cyberspectrum.de/), sponsored by by various agencies
and freelancers.

We would like to thank our contributors, whose efforts make this software what it is. These people have helped
by writing code, documentation, and by testing. They have created and maintained this product and its associated
extensions and are therefore the "[MetaModels Team](https://now.metamodel.me/de/ueber-uns/team)".

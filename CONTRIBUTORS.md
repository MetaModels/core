Initially developed by Christian Schiffler, sponsored by MEN AT WORK Werbeagentur GmbH.

We would like to thank our contributors, whose efforts make this software what it is.
These people have helped by writing code, documentation, and by testing.
They have created and maintained this product and its associated extensions and are therefore the "MetaModels team".
